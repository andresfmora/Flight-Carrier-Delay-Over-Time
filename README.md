# Flight-Carrier-Delay-Over-Time
The Carrier Delay visualization shows us, on average, how many minutes of departure delay can be attributed to a flight carrier over time. We can observe cyclical and long term trends as well as how flight carriers compare to each other. The Legend is interactive which lets us focus in on particular airlines one at a time. You will also find a linear regression line of the overall data-set which highlights the overall trend of the data over time.
